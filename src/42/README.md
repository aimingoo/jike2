# My TypeScript Project

This is a TypeScript project with the following structure:

```
my-typescript-project
├── src
│   └── index.ts
├── dist
├── tests
├── node_modules
├── .eslintrc.json
├── .prettierrc.json
├── rollup.config.js
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts`: This file is the entry point of the application. It contains the main TypeScript code for your project.

- `dist/`: This directory is where the compiled JavaScript files will be outputted after running the build process.

- `tests/`: This directory is where you can write your tests for the project.

- `node_modules/`: This directory is where the dependencies for your project will be installed.

- `.eslintrc.json`: This file is the configuration file for ESLint, a linter tool for JavaScript and TypeScript. It specifies the linting rules and configurations for your project.

- `.prettierrc.json`: This file is the configuration file for Prettier, a code formatter. It specifies the formatting rules for your project.

- `rollup.config.js`: This file is the configuration file for Rollup, a module bundler. It specifies how to bundle your TypeScript code into a single JavaScript file.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.

- `tsconfig.json`: This file is the configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options and the files to include in the compilation.

## Setup and Configuration

To set up and configure the tools for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure ESLint by modifying the `.eslintrc.json` file according to your project's linting rules.

5. Configure Prettier by modifying the `.prettierrc.json` file according to your project's formatting rules.

6. Configure Rollup by modifying the `rollup.config.js` file according to your project's bundling requirements.

7. Modify the `package.json` file to add any additional dependencies or scripts required for your project.

8. Start writing your TypeScript code in the `src/index.ts` file.

9. Run the build process to compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript by running the following command:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

10. Your compiled JavaScript files will be outputted in the `dist/` directory.

11. Write your tests in the `tests/` directory and run them using your preferred testing framework.

12. You can run linting and formatting checks by running the following commands:

    ```
    npm run lint
    npm run format
    ```

13. Update the `README.md` file to document your project.

That's it! You now have a basic TypeScript project set up with linting, formatting, bundling, and testing tools configured. Happy coding!
